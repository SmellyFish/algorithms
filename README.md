# Summary
This repo houses my solutions for programming question assignments for the [Algorithms: Design and Analysis](https://class.coursera.org/algo-007) class I took in the spring of 2015. The assignments were language agnostic. I picked Python so I could play around with a new language along the way.

I went through the class with the lovely and talented [Matt Rathbun](https://github.com/perfectgait). He has his own repo for these assignments [here](https://github.com/perfectgait/algorithms_design_analysis_part1).
